# OAuth2 / OpenId

OpenID Connect is a security mechanism for an application to contact an identity service, verify the identity of the End-User, and obtain End-User information using REST API's in a secure way.

OpenID Connect extends the OAuth 2.0 protocol. In other words, OpenID Connect is a simple identity layer that sits on the top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. OpenID Connect is needed because even though OAuth provides authorization, it does not provide authentication.
